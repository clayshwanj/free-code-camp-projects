              <strong>1963</strong>
              <p>Born: 9 August in Newark, New Jersey, United States.</p>

              <strong>1978</strong>
              <p>
                By the time she turned 15, Houston was performing often with her
                mother and trying to get a record deal of her own. Around the
                same time, she was discovered by a photographer who was awed by
                her natural beauty. She soon became an extremely sought-after
                teen model, one of the first African American women to appear on
                the cover of Seventeen magazine. But music remained her true
                love.

              <strong>1982</strong>
              <p>
                When she was 19, Houston was discovered in a nightclub by Arista
                Records' Clive Davis, who signed her immediately and took the
                helm of her career as she navigated from gospel to pop stardom.
                In 1983, Houston made her debut on national television,
                appearing on The Merv Griffin Show to sing "Home" from the
                musical The Wiz. She and Davis spent the next two years working
                on her debut album, finding the best producers and songwriters
                available to showcase her amazing vocal talent.

              <strong>1985</strong>
              <p>
                She released her debut album, Whitney Houston, and almost
                immediately became a smash pop sensation. Over the next year,
                her hit singles "Saving All My Love for You" and "How Will I
                Know" helped the album reach the top of the charts, where it
                stayed for 14 non-consecutive weeks. Houston won a Grammy in
                1986 for "Saving All My Love for You"; the award was presented
                to the singer by her cousin Dionne Warwick.

              <p>
                Houston followed the monumental success of her first album with
                a second release, Whitney, in 1987. That record, too, went
                platinum many times over and won a Grammy for the single "I
                Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)," with a successful
                world tour following. During this time, the singer also appeared
                at a concert for Nelson Mandela's birthday and founded the
                Whitney Houston Foundation for Children, a nonprofit
                organization that funds projects to help needy children over the
                world.

              <strong>1992</strong>
              <p>
                Houston was on top of the world, but her life was about to get
                very complicated very quickly. That year she married the R&B
                singer Bobby Brown, formerly of New Edition, after a three-year
                engagement. At first, the marriage was passionate and loving,
                but things turned sour as the decade progressed. Both Brown and
                Houston battled substance abuse and increasingly erratic
                behavior, with Houston later alluding to emotional abuse from
                Brown and domestic violence.

              <p>
                In spite of these growing personal troubles, Houston continued
                to progress in her career, crossing over successfully into
                acting in 1992 by starring opposite Kevin Costner in the wildly
                popular movie The Bodyguard. With this project, she set a trend
                for her films to follow: For each movie she also released hit
                singles, creating sensational record sales for the soundtracks.
                Her smash single from The Bodyguard, a cover of Dolly Parton's
                "I Will Always Love You" from 1974, proved to be Houston's
                biggest hit ever, spending a record-breaking 14 weeks atop the
                U.S. charts. The soundtrack album went on to win Houston three
                Grammys, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year.
                Later in the 1990s, Houston also starred in Waiting to Exhale
                and The Preacher's Wife, both accompanied by hit soundtracks as
                well.

              <strong>1998</strong>
              <p>
                In 1998, Houston released My Love Is Your Love, her first
                non-soundtrack studio album in many years, and it earned her
                another Grammy for the single "It's Not Right But It's Okay,"
                The album was not as successful as her previous full-length
                releases, though her collaboration with Mariah Carey in the
                animated film The Prince of Egypt produced a hit single, "When
                You Believe," which won an Academy Award. In the late 1990s and
                early 2000s, Houston's increasingly rocky marriage, struggles
                with drugs and health problems threatened to derail her career.
                Several concert cancellations and a notorious TV interview with
                Sawyer in 2002, in which Houston appeared far too thin and in
                poor health, led many to speculate that she was on the verge of
                a breakdown.

              <strong>2004</strong>
              <p>
                In 2004, when production began on the TV reality series Being
                Bobby Brown, Houston received substantial airtime. The show
                aired during the worst years of the couple's crumbling marriage;
                drug use, lifestyle excess and bad behavior were all caught on
                tape and Houston's reputation sunk to new lows. Houston tried to
                ignore the controversy, charging ahead with her music by
                releasing Just Whitneyâ€¦ to combat her detractors, but it did not
                match the success of her earlier works.

              <strong>2006</strong>
              <p>
                Whitney Houston was still celebrated as a singer, being named
                the most-awarded female artist of all time by Guinness World
                Records in 2006.

              <strong>2009</strong>
              <p>
                After almost a decade of struggling with her personal life,
                Houston seemed to be pulling herself together. She released a
                new album, I Look To You, in 2009. "The songs themselves will
                speak to you and you'll understand where I am and some of the
                changes I've gone through for the better," Houston told
                Entertainment Tonight. The recording received a warm welcome
                from music fans, making it to the top of album charts. Her live
                shows, however, garnered mixed reviews, with some complaining
                about the quality of her voice.

              <strong>2012</strong>
              <p>
                In early 2012, Houston was rumored to be experiencing financial
                trouble, but she denied this claim. Indeed, the artist seemed
                poised for a career upswing: Houston worked on the musical film
                Sparkle with Jordin Sparks, a remake of the 1976 movie about an
                all-girl musical group similar to The Supremes, and also
                reportedly had been approached to join the singing competition
                series The X Factor as a judge. Unfortunately, Houston did not
                live long enough to see the latest comeback reach fruition.
                Houston died at the age of 48 on February 11, 2012, in Los
                Angeles at a Beverly Hilton hotel where a Grammy party was being
                held by Davis. Houston had been seen out in the days before her
                death, including at one of the pre-Grammy parties. According to
                a report released by the Los Angeles County coroner's office on
                March 22, 2012, the official cause of her death was an
                accidental drowning. The effects of heart disease and cocaine
                found in her system were contributing factors as well. With her
                passing, the music world lost one of its most legendary stars.
