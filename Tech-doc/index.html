          Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying
          the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup
          language such as HTML or XML.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
          and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This separation can improve content accessibility provide more
          flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
          characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
          specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
          complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
          .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
          pages that share the file and its formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
          the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
          methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
          browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
          determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a
          property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
          predictable.
        </p>

          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C).

          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
          core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
          behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that
          executes the client code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and
          interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex
          actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without
          reloading the entire page.

          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
          design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
          significant indentation.
        </p>
        <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</p>
        <p>
          Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task
          automation, data analysis, and data visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many
          non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of
          everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

          Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing
          and processing information in a relational database.
        </p>
        <p>
          A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows
          and columns representing different data attributes and the various
          relationships between the data values.
        </p>
        <p>SQL is used to communicate with a database.</p>
        <p>
          Learning SQL is generally considered easier than many other
          programming languages, and mastery of SQL can facilitate learning
          other programming languages such as Python or JavaScript. Knowledge of
          SQL can open many professional doors across various industries
          including finance, social media, and music.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL statements in Excel allow you to connect to an external data
          source, parse fields or table contents, and import data without having
          to manually enter the data.
